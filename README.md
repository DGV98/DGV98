<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hi, I'm David ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## About Me
I am an enthusiastic self-taught software engineer with a focus on designing customer-driven products. Before this, I graduated from the University of Chicago majoring in Molecular Engineering with a focus on Quantum Information, as I am passionate about learning how the new generation of computers might change our society. Currently I am working on building my front end development skills by building out generative AI applications, but I love using Python to generate data driven insights.
